# Task System Removal Summary

## Date: 2025-08-08

### What Was Done

#### 1. Fixed Asyncio Event Loop Error
- **Problem**: Carbon daily scheduler crashed with "Future attached to a different loop" error
- **Solution**: Added `await engine.dispose()` at the end of `run_daily_tasks()` to clean up database connections
- **File Modified**: `scripts/carbon_daily_scheduler.py`
- **Result**: Scheduler now runs successfully without errors

#### 2. Complete Task System Removal
Successfully removed all task-related code from the system:

**Files Deleted**:
- `app/api/v1/endpoints/tasks.py`
- `app/schemas/task.py`
- `app/models/task.py`
- `app/services/league_service.py`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/v1/api.py` - Removed task router
- `app/api/v1/endpoints/progress.py` - Removed task-related endpoints and fields
- `app/models/user.py` - Removed `user_tasks` relationship and `current_month_tasks_completed` field
- `app/models/monthly_summary.py` - Removed `tasks_completed` and `total_points_earned` fields
- `app/models/__init__.py` - Removed task imports
- `migrations/env.py` - Removed task model import
- `scripts/carbon_daily_scheduler.py` - Removed task fields from monthly summary creation
- `scripts/carbon_league_promotion.py` - Removed task fields from monthly summary updates

**Database Migration**:
- Created `migrations/versions/008_remove_task_system.py`
- Drops `tasks` and `user_tasks` tables
- Removes task-related columns from `users` and `monthly_summaries` tables

### Backup Created
- Task data backed up to: `task_backup_20250808_201914.json`
- Contains: 12 tasks, 99 user task assignments, 1 user with task progress

### Current State
- League promotion is now **purely carbon-based** with thresholds:
  - Bronze → Silver: 100g CO2e
  - Silver → Gold: 500g CO2e
  - Gold → Emerald: 700g CO2e
  - Emerald → Diamond: 1000g CO2e
- No task dependencies remain in the codebase
- All endpoints function correctly without tasks

### Next Steps for Flutter App
The Flutter app still expects task data. Update these areas:
1. Remove task UI components from dashboard
2. Remove `/api/v1/tasks` and `/api/v1/progress/tasks` API calls
3. Update progress display to show only carbon-based progression
4. Remove task-related fields from data models

### Testing
- ✅ Database migration successful
- ✅ Task tables and columns removed
- ✅ Carbon scheduler runs without errors
- ✅ API endpoints function correctly (pending full test with running backend)
